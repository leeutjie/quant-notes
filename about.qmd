This blog is all about notes to myself about code, data science and quantitative finance. I record golden nuggets of information and tips that I have learnt, and how-to processes that I might want to refer back to. The idea behind each blog is to offer concise, cheat sheet-like advice for future self. In this blog I give no context or explanation beyond what is useful to me for any other reader. This is a selfish blog, but I'm really nice. Promise.
